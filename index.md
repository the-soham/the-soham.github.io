Hi there! Nice to meet you.<br><br> My name is Soham Bhagwat. Iâ€™m a Master's student pursing MS in Data Science specializing in Big Data Systems at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.iu.edu/) . I am mostly interested in Applied ML, NLP and Statistical Inference. During the Fall'23 semester, I have served as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the course [SPEA-V 506: Statistical Analysis for Effective Decision Making](https://utilities.registrar.indiana.edu/course-browser/prl/soc4208/SPEA/SPEA-V506.shtml) taught by [Dr.Barry M.

Prior to that I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering with honors in AI and ML from [SPPU](http://www.unipune.ac.in/), Pune where my undergraduate thesis was based upon Optical Recognition of Handwritten Text.<br><br>
During my third year of Engineering, I interned at [PTC](http://www.ptc.com/), a Forbes 500 company, as DevOps Engineer intern and was a part of the team responsible for deploying their flagship product - Windchill.
