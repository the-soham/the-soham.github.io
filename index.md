Hi there! Nice to meet you.<br><br> My name is Soham Bhagwat. Iâ€™m a Data Science graduate specializing in Big Data Systems from [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.iu.edu/) . I am mostly interested in Applied ML and Statistical Inference. I served as Graduate Teaching Assistant/Co-instructor for the course [SPEA-P 507 - Data Analysis and Modeling](https://utilities.registrar.indiana.edu/course-browser/prl/soc4102/SPEA/SPEA-V507.html) during the Spring'24 semester and [SPEA-V 506: Statistical Analysis for Effective Decision Making](https://utilities.registrar.indiana.edu/course-browser/prl/soc4208/SPEA/SPEA-V506.shtml) for the Fall'24 semester taught by [Professor Emeritus Dr.Barry M. Rubin](https://oneill.indiana.edu/faculty-research/directory/profiles/faculty/full-time/rubin-barry.html) .<br><br>

Prior to that I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering with honors in AI and ML from [SPPU](http://www.unipune.ac.in/), Pune where my undergraduate thesis was based upon Optical Recognition of Handwritten Text.<br><br>
During my third year of Engineering, I interned at [PTC](https://www.ptc.com/), a Forbes 500 company, as DevOps Engineer intern and was a part of the team responsible for deploying their flagship product - Windchill.
