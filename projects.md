### Asteroid Deep Water Impact

Various simulation runs were performed on the Deep Water Impact [dataset](https://sciviscontest2018.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2017/09/DeepWaterImpactEnsembleDataSet_Revision1.pdf) to study about the impact of the asteroid when it crashes the ocean surface.
The scientific visualization contrasts the water fraction, asteroid fraction, and pressure variables between two ensemble runs. In the first scenario, the asteroid impacts the ocean without undergoing an airburst, while in the second scenario, an airburst occurs as the asteroid breaks apart before reaching impact In all cases the simulation starts with an asteroid falling to earth from the upper atmosphere at a high velocity. The atmosphere and water start in a static state with
no kinetic energy. The computational grid is made as small as sufficiently possible while allowing the asteroid to come in at an angle from the longest dimension, impact the center of water surface, and not make the crater in the water extend to the ocean floor.

This simulations were performed using [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) and the animations were edited in [kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) .

### United States Tornado Analysis

This is a Data Analysis project focused on the occurences of Tornadoes in the US.We deep dive into the tornado data from the year 1950 through 2021.
We use the dataset produced by NOAA's Storm Prediction Center to gain insights into how and which regions were highly affected by the touchdown of tornadoes
and the destruction caused by them.
